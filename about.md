### Hello, I'm Lester

I'm a software developer, and I'm looking to complete my Computer Science degree at the National University of Singapore in the summer of 2019. I like building useful things, although sometimes I build useless but cool stuff :) Check out some of [my work](/#portfolio)!

#### How I got started

I always told myself that I wanted to be a mechanical engineer, until some [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile) videos made me change my mind. This was a day before I had to decide on my major. It was as impulsive an impulse decision could be, yet it's the best impulse decision I have ever made in my life.

I spent two years in university designing circuits and programming microcontrollers before shifting my focus to software development. Since then, I've had the privilege of interning at several companies in Singapore and in California, working under mentors whose patient guidance taught me so much.

#### Technical skills

I don't think software engineering is a race to learn as many programming languages and frameworks as possible, so I try to learn those that introduce a new way of thinking.

Regardless, here are the technical items I have more experience in:

 - ★★★  Python, Django, C++, Hacklang
 - ★★   C, Node.js, PHP, GraphQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL
