<div class="about-page">
Born in Singapore; currently based in Hong Kong.

I first began programming, and my software engineering journey by impulsively taking up Computer Science after watching some Computerphile videos one late summer night. My journey so far has taken me across the world - from Singapore, to Silicon Valley, and to Hong Kong where I currently reside.

Over the years, I have learned so much from my peers and my mentors. As such, I actively seek collaborative environments where I can continue to grow, both technically and non-technically, and also share what I have learnt with others.

When I am not thinking about ones and zeroes, I can be found losing miserably at board games, fumbling in the badminton courts, or lazing around at one of Hong Kong's many scenic spots.
