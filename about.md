<div class="about-page">
I'm a software engineer based in Singapore.

I began programming (and my software engineering career) by impulsively taking up Computer Science after watching some Computerphile videos one late summer night. My journey so far has taken me across the world -- from Singapore, to Silicon Valley, to Hong Kong, and back to Singapore again, where I currently reside.

Over the years, I have learned so much from my peers and my mentors. As such, I actively seek collaborative environments where I can continue to grow, both technically and non-technically, and also share what I have learnt with others.

When I am not thinking about ones and zeroes, I can be found coming up with questionable strategies over a board game, fumbling in the badminton courts, or lazing around at one of Singapore's many cafes.
